# 📘 Academic Writings

This section is for rigorously formatted academic writing across all disciplines. It’s designed to help contributors—especially students—understand the structure and clarity of scholarly work, while sharing ideas in an open, respectful space.

## 📄 Submission Format

- PDF only (LaTeX strongly encouraged)
- Must include:
  - Title
  - Author name
  - Date
  - Abstract
  - Section headings
  - References (if applicable)

Submissions should follow arXiv-style formatting for clarity and structure. See `https://github.com/LdcPhysics/LDC-Writings/blob/dbff2297562d17fc3184a3e5491655981cfc69cc/QHE%20(10).pdf` for layout guidance.

## 🧠 Tone & Spirit

- Curious, rigorous, and respectful
- Exploratory ideas are welcome
- Rigor is encouraged but not required—submissions won’t be rejected for being informal, but top spots favor clarity and depth

## 🚫 Rules

- No hate speech
- No plagiarism
- No pseudoscience

Submissions violating these rules will be removed.

## 🏆 Prizes

Every two weeks, one academic submission may be anonymously selected for a cash prize. Selection is based on resonance, clarity, and depth—not metrics or optimization.
