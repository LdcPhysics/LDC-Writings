# LDC-Writings
A free, public archive for rigorously formatted writing across all disciplines. Submit clean PDF or LaTeX files, organized like arXiv. No hate speech or pseudoscience. Every two months, top entries win prizes—one for academic rigor, one for creative exploration. Open to all. Built for clarity, depth, and bold thought.
This is a free, public archive for rigorously formatted writing across all disciplines—built to help people, especially students, get a sense of academic writing and share their ideas. Whether you're just starting out or already deep in your field, this space is for you.

We host two main sections:

Academic Rigor: STEM-focused writing with arXiv-style formatting. Initial categories include physics, logic, philosophy, and zoology. Submissions must be clean PDFs or LaTeX-compiled PDFs with title, author name, and date. Formatting should follow academic standards—examples provided.

Creative Exploration: Poetry, short stories, and reviews of music, art, or other creative works. No formatting rules here—just clarity, originality, and bold thought.

Anyone can submit, but bi-weekly prizes are reserved for student contributors with clear intentions. Winners are selected anonymously—no optimization, no metrics—just what resonates. One prize goes to a standout academic piece, and one to a creative submission. Cash awards for now, with hopes of expanding as the community grows.

Submissions must be respectful: no hate speech, plagiarism, or pseudoscience. Moderation is light but present. Rigor is encouraged, but not required—submissions won’t be rejected for being exploratory or informal, though top spots favor clarity and depth.

Contributors can’t create new folders, but suggestions are welcome. My email is listed at the bottom of the repository for feedback and ideas.

This is a space for curiosity, creativity, and intellectual freedom. Let’s build something thoughtful together.
